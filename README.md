# MicroSrategy_Dossier_PresentationMode


There has been a continuous ask from MicroStrategy users to run the dossier, default into "Presentation Mode", as no business users want to run it in Edit mode and then click on Presentation mode to get a nice dossier experience, and it becomes a daunting task when you are dealing with Sr. Execs in any organization. We know MicroStrategy has been pushing for Library app for Dossier comsumption, but there's a long way to go.

So to reduce the pain of asking every BI user to click on Presentation mode after running a dossier on MSTR Web, I wrote this MSTR Web Customization Plug-in, which runs the dossier, default into Presentation mode. It's compatible with both ASP/JSP versions of MSTR Web. Just unzip it into your *"MSTR Web Installation Folder \ Plugins"* folder and restart the web server. That's all!!

Please let me know if it is really helpful.

Happy Data Exploring...!!!
